To start a NEW session, click on Delete Record. This will put all the timers at max. Otherwise, the levels will not unlock after completing the previous one.
It uses Playerpref and looks for if the # > 0 and less than 10 minutes.

A-D/ arrow keys to move left and right
"Space" to change gravity
Z to change layer
ESC to go to the level menu
R to restart the level. Pressing R to restart is faster than dying or waiting for iminent doom.
(Left to move || (xbox only) A to gravity || X to layer shift || start for menu)
   *Bug on controller only - You can’t choose the levels after entering the first time. Could had fixed it if I had more time.
Added cheat key - U key will unlock everything. -

There was a bug where the player couldn't do anything on the Canvas.
It wasn't the canvas, it was the event system.
The old event system had no code at all and nothing called it.
I deleted it and added a new one. Fixed the issue - Eric

Thanks for letting us resubmit and thanks for being our professor. I am sorry if I lost my temper on the layer shifting moment. I have been stressed out this week because of the workload that I am getting. I did most of the work and debugging and slept really late this morning plus I had 3 more finals after that one so my mind was in another place. - Eric
