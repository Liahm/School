For question 4 and 5 I am not sure if they are right.
I used my code from the last assignment for the insert and, well. It's
reverse and it feels so weird. It technically merges(4), but not sorted.

For question 6 I at first did number two, my tests didn't work and I
skipped, but I had all the information definition and classes so I reused
them. Also I had a lot of issues creating tests cases for this question. A
lot of 'int' isn't a cellspace.

For huffman I was planning to do it without importing any directories
because I didn't know if we were allowed to use any. I ran out of time (It
was around 9pm when I decided to change it) and decided to use heapq
